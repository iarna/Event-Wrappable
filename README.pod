=head1 NAME

Event::Wrappable - Sugar to let you instrument event listeners at a distance

=head1 VERSION

version 0.1.0

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Event::Wrappable;
    use AnyEvent;
    use EV;
    
    my $wrapper = Event::Wrappable->add_event_wrapper( sub { 
        my( $event ) = @_;
        return sub { say "Calling event..."; $event->(); say "Done with event" };
        } );
    my $w = AE::timer 1, 0, event { say "First timer triggered" };
    Event::Wrappable->remove_event_wrapper($wrapper);
    my $w2 = AE::timer 2, 0, event { say "Second timer triggered" };
    EV::loop;

    # Will print:
    #     Calling event...
    #     First timer triggered
    #     Done with event
    #     Second timer triggered

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a helper for creating globally wrapped events listeners.  This is a
way of augmenting all of the event listeners registered during a period of
time.  See L<AnyEvent::Collect> and L<MooseX::Event> for examples of its
use.  A lexically scoped variant might be desirable, however I'll have to
explore the implications of that for my own use cases first.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 method add_event_wrapper( CodeRef $wrapper ) returns CodeRef

Wrappers are called in reverse declaration order.  They take a the event
to be added as an argument, and return a wrapped event.

=head2 method remove_event_wrapper( CodeRef $wrapper )

Removes a previously added event wrapper.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 method get_unwrapped() returns CodeRef

Returns the original, unwrapped event handler from the wrapped version.

=head2 method get_wrappers() returns Array|ArrayRef

In list context returns an array of the wrappers used on this event.  In
scalar context returns an arrayref of the wrappers used on this event.

=head2 method object_id() returns Int

Returns an invariant unique identifier for this event.  This will not change
even across threads and is suitable for hashing based on an event.

=head1 HELPERS

=head2 sub event( CodeRef $code ) returns CodeRef

Returns the wrapped code ref, to be passed to an event handler
